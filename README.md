# Implementation of Writing an Interpreter in Go

This is my Go implementation of the Monkey interpreter from the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball. The book is a great resource for learning how to write an interpreter and I highly recommend it. The book is available at ["https://interpreterbook.com](https://interpreterbook.com/).
